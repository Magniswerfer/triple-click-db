# TripleClick Database

This is a small personal project for my favorite podcast Tripleclick.
Inspired by the now dead handb.dk, for the defunct Danish podcast Han Duo.

I am pretty much a noob-programmer, so loads of this is generated with Claude. It's really good, but the codebase it probably a mess :)

## Tech-stack
I use Deno 2.0, Deno KV, and Fresh :)
